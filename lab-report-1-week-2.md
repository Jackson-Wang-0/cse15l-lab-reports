### Let's begin the Tutorial !!!
# Visual Studio Code

1. First, You need to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) on your computer. After it is installed, double click the icon and you will end up in a screen which looks something like this. (it could be a little different)

# Remotely Connecting

- Window users need to [install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) to connect your computer to another computer.

Next, each student have their own course-specific account which can be found at: [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)


_Note: for CSE15L, our account starts with **cs15lwi22**_


Enter the following command but replace `abc` with the letters of your course-specific account 


```
ssh cs15lwi22abc@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

If this is your first time connecting to a server, you will get a message like this:
```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
We usually type `yes` in this case and then it will ask for your password!

After you successfully logged in with your password, the output should look like this：

If you made it this far, congrats! Your terminal is now connected!!!

# Moving Files with scp




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jackson-Wang-0/Week-2-Lab-Report/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jackson-Wang-0/Week-2-Lab-Report/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
